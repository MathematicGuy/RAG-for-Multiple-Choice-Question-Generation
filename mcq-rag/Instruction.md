# RAG System for Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) Generation

## System Overview

This document outlines the design of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically tailored for generating high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) from educational documents.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
```
PDF Documents → Text Extraction → Semantic Chunking → Vector Storage
```

**Key Features:**
- **Document Loader**: PyPDFLoader for PDF processing
- **Semantic Chunking**: Using SemanticChunker with percentile-based breakpoints
- **Embedding Model**: Vietnamese-bi-encoder for Vietnamese language support
- **Vector Database**: FAISS for efficient similarity search

### 2. Question Generation Engine

**Core Components:**
- **Retriever**: Top-k document retrieval based on context relevance
- **LLM**: Quantized models (Gemma-2B, Vicuna-7B) for generation
- **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts for MCQ format
- **Output Parser**: JSON-based structured output

### 3. MCQ Structure Design

```json
{
  "question": "What is Object-Oriented Programming?",
  "context": "Relevant extracted content from documents",
  "options": {
    "A": "A programming paradigm based on objects",
    "B": "A database management system",
    "C": "A web development framework",
    "D": "A testing methodology"
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data or objects",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "topic": "Programming Fundamentals",
  "source": "Week_3_Buoi_T3+T4_OOP.pdf, Page 5"
}
```

## Enhanced System Design

### 1. Multi-Level Question Generation

#### Level 1: Factual Questions
- Direct information retrieval from documents
- Basic comprehension testing
- Example: "What is the definition of inheritance in OOP?"

#### Level 2: Conceptual Questions
- Understanding relationships between concepts
- Application of principles
- Example: "Which OOP principle is violated when..."

#### Level 3: Analytical Questions
- Problem-solving scenarios
- Multiple document synthesis
- Example: "Given the following code snippet, what design pattern..."

### 2. Advanced RAG Components

#### A. Context-Aware Retrieval
```python
class ContextAwareRetriever:
    def __init__(self, vector_db, diversity_threshold=0.7):
        self.vector_db = vector_db
        self.diversity_threshold = diversity_threshold

    def retrieve_diverse_contexts(self, query, k=5):
        # Retrieve documents with semantic diversity
        # Ensure coverage of different aspects
        pass
```

#### B. Question Type Classification
```python
class QuestionTypeClassifier:
    QUESTION_TYPES = {
        "definition": "What is...",
        "comparison": "Compare and contrast...",
        "application": "In which scenario...",
        "evaluation": "Which is the best approach..."
    }
```

#### C. Difficulty Assessment
```python
class DifficultyAnalyzer:
    def assess_difficulty(self, question, context):
        factors = {
            "concept_complexity": self.analyze_concepts(context),
            "prerequisite_knowledge": self.check_prerequisites(question),
            "cognitive_load": self.calculate_cognitive_load(question)
        }
        return self.compute_difficulty_score(factors)
```

### 3. Prompt Engineering Strategy

#### Base MCQ Generation Prompt
```
Role: Expert educator and question designer
Task: Generate a multiple-choice question from the provided context

Requirements:
1. Create one clear, unambiguous question
2. Provide exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D)
3. Only one correct answer
4. Distractors should be plausible but clearly incorrect
5. Include explanation for the correct answer
6. Specify difficulty level and topic

Context: {context}
Topic Focus: {topic}
Difficulty Level: {difficulty}

Output Format: JSON only
```

#### Advanced Prompts for Different Question Types

**Definition Questions:**
```
Generate a definition-based MCQ that tests understanding of key terminology.
Focus on precise definitions and common misconceptions.
```

**Application Questions:**
```
Create a scenario-based question that requires applying concepts to solve problems.
Include realistic situations where the concept would be used.
```

**Analysis Questions:**
```
Design a question that requires analyzing code, diagrams, or complex scenarios.
Test deeper understanding and critical thinking skills.
```

### 4. Quality Assurance System

#### A. Automatic Quality Checks
```python
class MCQValidator:
    def validate_question(self, mcq):
        checks = {
            "has_single_correct_answer": self.check_single_correct(),
            "options_are_distinct": self.check_distinct_options(),
            "question_clarity": self.assess_clarity(),
            "distractor_quality": self.evaluate_distractors(),
            "context_relevance": self.check_relevance()
        }
        return all(checks.values()), checks
```

#### B. Difficulty Calibration
```python
class DifficultyCalibrator:
    def calibrate_difficulty(self, mcq_batch):
        # Analyze question complexity
        # Adjust difficulty ratings
        # Ensure balanced distribution
        pass
```

### 5. Evaluation Metrics

#### Content Quality Metrics
- **Relevance Score**: How well the question relates to source content
- **Clarity Index**: Linguistic clarity and unambiguity
- **Distractor Quality**: Plausibility of incorrect options
- **Difficulty Accuracy**: Alignment between intended and actual difficulty

#### System Performance Metrics
- **Generation Speed**: Questions per minute
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of valid MCQs generated
- **Diversity Score**: Variety in question types and topics
- **Coverage Rate**: Percentage of source content utilized
